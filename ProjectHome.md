Pimp My Ball is a networked virtual environment developed in JMonkey. In it, the player controls a rolling ball that just loves to play board games. Players can start a game (within the game) by bumping into another player. This will bring up a board on which the two players meet in a game of Gomoku. By winning games players can gain rank points, which can be used to purchase bling for the ball avatar (thereby the pimping). The player with the most points get to wear the golden crown of the champion!
